#In Python it is all known that string is immutable.when a string reference is reinitialized with a new valueit is creating a new object rather thanoverwriting
#the previous value. In Python, strings are made immutable so that programmers cannot alter the contents of the object (even by mistake). This avoids unnecessary bugs.
#because strings don't support item assignment, thus they are immutable. Something is mutable only when
# we are able to change the values held in the memory location without changing the memory location itself.

#replace method in python will replaces all occurunces of a char or word in the string. This is a case sensitive method.
#syntax:       str.replace(self,old_,new_,count/' ') where ' ' means all occurunces
#returns a copy of the string where all occurrences of a substring are replaced with another substring.
