#Python isspace() method is used to check space in the string. It return true if there are only whitespace characters in the string.
# Otherwise it returns false. Space, newline, and tabs etc are known as whitespace characters and are defined in the Unicode character database as Other or Separator.
#whitespace is a pre-initialized string used as string constant.
#Unicode Character Database (UCD) is defined by Unicode Standard Annex #44 which defines the character properties for all unicode characters.
# In python3 All strings are Unicode by default
# (UNICODE and UTF8(which is a vairable width encoding standard which encodes the bytes with different number of code points betwn 1 and 4))
# and contain any unicode character
#ascii is from 0 to 128 codepoints  while unicode is from 0 to (hex) 0x10FFFF ie 11,14,112 possible code points
#code point is an integer value that uniquely identifies the given character
